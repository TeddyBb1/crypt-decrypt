# 🔐 crypt-decrypt

Welcome to **crypt-decrypt**, a project by [TeddyBb1](https://github.com/TeddyBb1)! 🎉

This simple yet powerful application allows you to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using two popular encryption methods: **Caesar Cipher** and **Vigenère Cipher**. 🛡️🔑

## 📄 About the Project

The **crypt_decrypt.py** application provides a user-friendly graphical interface built with **Tkinter**. You can choose the encryption method, input your text and key, and the application will instantly encrypt or decrypt your message. ✨

### Features:
- 🔑 **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypts and decrypts text by shifting letters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- 🔑 **Vigenère Cipher**: Uses a keyword to create a more complex substitution cipher.
- 💻 **User-friendly GUI**: Built with **Tkinter** for an intuitive and seamless experience.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TeddyBb1/crypt-decrypt.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd crypt-decrypt
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```
   **Note:** This installs the necessary `tkinter` library on Linux systems. For Windows and macOS, `tkinter` is usually included by default in Python installations.
   
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python crypt_decrypt.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- **Python 3.x** 🐍
- **Tkinter** (for GUI, installed with the command above if not already available)
